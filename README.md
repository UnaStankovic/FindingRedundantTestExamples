# FindingRedundantTestExamples
This project is a part of my Master Studies' course of Software Verification. The main idea is to explore, experiment and try to develop a methodology of discovering and removing redundant test examples in big open source project such as llc tool for LLVM. This project is done in collaboration with Mirko Brkusanin and Milos Samardzija who also attend the course during summer semester of 2018th.
